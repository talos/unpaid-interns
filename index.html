                      <p>Welcome to this short exercise designed to highlight the
                      conditions by which your unpaid internship may or may not
                      be in compliance with labor laws, specifically those
                      concerning the minimum wage and overtime. The US Department
                      of Labor has published clear <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm">guidelines</a>
                      to help determine whether an unpaid internship at
                      a for-profit employer complies with federal labor laws.
                      Unpaid internships at government agencies and at
                      not-for-profit organizations may also be in compliance if
                      they meet certain <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/scope/ee16.asp">conditions
                        for volunteering</a>. Please note that receiving academic
                      credit has no bearing on any of these laws. Individual
                      states and some municipalities have their own labor laws
                      that might be more stringent.</p>

                      <p>This survey will help see how your internship matches up
                      against the federal standards.</p>

                      <p>When completing this survey please answer the questions
                      as they apply to just one internship (if you've done more
                      than one), whether it is your current, most recent, or most
                      demanding. We pledge to keep your identity confidential and

                          <p>Based on your answers it looks like your
                          internship might not meet the requirements
                          established by the U.S. Supreme Court for it to be
                          unpaid and still comply with the federal Fair Labor
                          Standards Act. You may be legally owed pay, including
                          back pay, plus damages.</p>

                          internship doesn't pay at least the minimum wage, and
                          New York State uses an 11-point test that goes beyond

                          employers).</p>

                          <p> Please note that at the federal level and in most
                          states, unpaid interns are not considered employees
                          and are not protected by laws against workplace
                          discrimination or sexual harassment. Securing those
                          protections if you have been misclassified might be
                          possible, but more difficult than if you were
                          properly classified as an employee.</p>

                          <p> For more information on any legal remedy you can
                          claim we advise you to consult a lawyer.</p>

                            <p>However, there is a chance that your internship,
                            though not satisfying federal or state
                            trainee-tests, can legally be unpaid if you are
                            classified as a volunteer. The FLSA allows
                            volunteering at not-for-profit organizations under
                            certain circumstances, when it is done, “usually on
                            a part-time basis, for public service, religious,
                            or humanitarian objectives." (U.S. Department of
                            Labor Opinion Letter). Note that those
                            circumstances do not include earning academic
                            credit, burnishing a résumé, or professional
                            networking, and volunteering may not displace
                            someone's job. The more your internship looks like
                            a job (e.g., full-time instead of part-time, an
                            ongoing position instead of a position of brief
                            duration, reporting to a boss and having
                            responsibilities instead of working as you see fit)
                            the more likely it is.</p>

                            <p>Also note that if you receive a stipend for your
                            internship, it increases the likelihood that courts
                            would see your position as that of an employee. If
                            the stipend is for less than the minimum wage would
                            provide, your employer is likely not in compliance
                            with the FLSA.</p>

                          <p>Congratulations, it appears that you may engaged
                          in an unpaid internship that meets the federal
                          standard for it to be in compliance with the FLSA.
                          Your state's labor laws might be more stringent—for
                          example,  <a target="_blank"

                          of labor or a lawyer for more information that may
                          apply to you.</p>

                          <p>Note that since unpaid interns are generally not
                          considered employees you may not have any legal
                          protection against discrimination or sexual
                          harassment, among other workplace protections.
                          Oregon, however, recently passed a law (House Bill
                          2669) extending workplace protections to interns.</p>

                          Accountability Act of 1995 — went out of its way to
                          exclude interns: “[T]he term ‘covered employee’ does
                          not include an intern.” It is unclear what workplace
