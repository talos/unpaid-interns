                      <p>Welcome to this short exercise designed to highlight the
                      conditions by which your unpaid internship may or may not
                      be in compliance with labor laws, specifically those
                      concerning the minimum wage and overtime.

                      <p>
                      The US Department
                      of Labor has published clear <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm">guidelines</a>
                      to help determine whether an unpaid internship at
                      a for-profit employer complies with federal labor laws.
                      Unpaid internships at government agencies and at
                      not-for-profit organizations may also be in compliance if
                      they meet certain <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/scope/ee16.asp">conditions
                        for volunteering</a>. Please note that receiving academic
                      credit has no bearing on any of these laws. Individual
                      states and some municipalities have their own labor laws
                      that might be more stringent.</p>

                      <p>These questions will help see how your internship matches up
                      against the federal standards.</p>

                      <p>Please answer the questions as they apply to just one
                      internship (if you've done more than one), whether it is
                      your current, most recent, or most demanding. We pledge
                      to keep your identity confidential and will provide an
                      option to register to receive a report of our results
                      and/or join our mailing list at the end of the
                      survey.</p>

                          established by the U.S. Supreme Court for it to be
                          unpaid and still comply with the federal Fair Labor
                          Standards Act. You may be legally owed pay, including
                          back pay, plus damages.</p>

                          test the Court established, the U.S. Department of

                          even more stringent. For example, <a target="_blank"

                          internship doesn't pay at least the minimum wage, and
                          New York State uses an 11-point test that goes beyond
                          the federal 6-point test (this is the <a

                          employers).</p>

                          <p> Please note that at the federal level and in most
                          states, unpaid interns are not considered employees
                          and are not protected by laws against workplace
                          discrimination or sexual harassment. Securing those
                          protections if you have been misclassified might be
                          possible, but more difficult than if you were
                          properly classified as an employee.</p>

                          <p> For more information on any legal remedy you can
                          claim we advise you to consult a lawyer.</p>

                          <div id="fail-not-for-profit">
                            <p>However, there is a chance that your internship,
                            though not satisfying federal or state
                            trainee-tests, can legally be unpaid if you are
                            classified as a volunteer. The FLSA allows
                            volunteering at not-for-profit organizations under
                            certain circumstances, when it is done, “usually on
                            a part-time basis, for public service, religious,
                            or humanitarian objectives." (U.S. Department of
                            Labor Opinion Letter). Note that those
                            circumstances do not include earning academic
                            credit, burnishing a résumé, or professional
                            networking, and volunteering may not displace
                            someone's job. The more your internship looks like
                            a job (e.g., full-time instead of part-time, an
                            ongoing position instead of a position of brief
                            duration, reporting to a boss and having
                            responsibilities instead of working as you see fit)
                            the more likely it is.</p>

                            <p>Also note that if you receive a stipend for your
                            internship, it increases the likelihood that courts
                            would see your position as that of an employee. If
                            the stipend is for less than the minimum wage would
                            provide, your employer is likely not in compliance
                            with the FLSA.</p>

                            trainee-tests, can legally be unpaid if you are
                            classified as a volunteer. The FLSA allows
                            volunteering at state and local governments by
                            someone "who performs hours of service for a public
                            agency for civic, charitable, or humanitarian
                            reasons." Note that "hours of service" does not
                            suggest full-time work, and that the purposes cited
                            do not include work undertaken for professional
                            advancement. A government employee cannot volunteer
                            to do the same kind of work they are normally paid
                            for.

                            The FLSA applies to "any individual employed by the
                            Government of the United States" — though Congress
                            elsewhere exempts itself, and only itself, from
                            applying the FLSA to interns. Therefore, if you
                            work for a federal government body other than
                            Congress, your internships should also have to meet
                            the Supreme Court's 6-point trainee test if it is
                            to be unpaid. Note: This legal reasoning has not
                            yet been tested in court, but we are looking
                            forward to seeing cases come forward and seeing
                            this interpretation confirmed.

                          <p>Congratulations, it appears that you may engaged
                          in an unpaid internship that meets the federal

                          Your state's labor laws might be more stringent—for

                          apply to you.</p>

                          <p>Note that since unpaid interns are generally not

                          protection against discrimination or sexual
                          harassment, among other workplace protections.
                          Oregon, however, recently passed a law (House Bill
                          2669) extending workplace protections to interns.</p>

                          exclude interns: “[T]he term ‘covered employee’ does
