# Unpaid Internship Questionnaire

The vast majority of unpaid internships are illegal.

Just because you're getting academic credit, or because you're interning for a
nonprofit, doesn't mean that you're not entitled to minimum wage.

Individuals who work without pay, even if the situation is illegal, may find
themselves without recourse to the law when they are abused or mistreated at
their workplace.

The full six-point test for establishing an internship's legality is [here].
I've adapted a quick-and-dirty subset of these questions for maximum impact;
some illegal internships could probably slip through.  There are also weird
exemptions ([Congress]!) that wouldn't be caught.

If you feel that one of the questions is inaccurate or could be better phrased,
or you want to contribute a question or a feature, please fork the repository
